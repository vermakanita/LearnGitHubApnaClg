 how we add files in git<br>
    <h2>git add</h2>
    <p>git add is used to add files to the staging area in git. The staging area is a place where you can prepare files before committing them to the repository.</p>
    <p>When you run the command <code>git add <file_name></code>, it tells git to start tracking the changes made to that file. This means that any changes you make to that file will be included in the next commit.</p>
    <p>For example, if you have a file called <code>index.html</code> and you want to add it to the staging area, you would run the command:</p>
    <pre><code>git add index.html</code></pre>
    <p>This will add the <code>index.html</code> file to the staging area, and it will be included in the next commit you make.</p>
    <p>You can also add multiple files at once by specifying their names separated by spaces:</p>
    <pre><code>git add file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt</code></pre>
    <p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>.</code> (dot) to add all files in the current directory and its subdirectories:</p>
